NOTE:  This is rather 'experimental'.  Something like this is necessary, but
  would be better off using an existing plugin architecture (such as yapsy), 
  instead of the simplified one contained in this code, which was written 
  from 'scratch'.

Fedora Object Builder/Ingester...

Meant to be able to add the base datastreams from a file or directory, using a certain module/configuration.
Addtional datastream manipulation should be performed via Microservices.

Only XMLHandler is currently implemented, which creates an instance of the class specified in the config with each element matching the provided pattern, and calls "process" on each instance.  (FileHandler should work similarly, passing the line matched to the class to create, and calling "process".

- Currently "dependant" upon Python 2.6 (2.5 might also work, but I was 
  referring to the 2.6 docs while writing and I don't think I've used anything
  which appeared after 2.5.  The one issue might be in the "#!/usr/bin/env 
  python2.6" which is oddly enough due to compatibility reasons.)
